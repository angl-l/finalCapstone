        <h2>This is a space to track your fitness journey. Think of it as your digital fitness journal.</h2>
        <p class="list">Let me walk you through it: </p>
        <li class="list">This is the home page which acts as a tutorial for the journal.</li>
        <li class="list">The Weight Loss Tracker will contain graphs and a tracker to be able to track your weight.
            This page is a little over my skill set at the moment so will be kept empty for now.</li>
        <li class="list">The Workout Split page contains a table with a weekly schedule of workout and in future,
            it will also contain the exercises scheduled for each day.</li>
        <li class="list">Finally, the Blog is a space where you can find blog posts categorised in 3 different categories: educational articles,
            workout of the day logs and mental health checks. Right now, it shows a template of an article.</li>
